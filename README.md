# Welcome to my Data Science Project!

Hello there!

## Project Overview

In this project, I have focused on creating heterogeneous node embeddings. These embeddings can be incredibly useful in various applications such as recommendation systems, community detection, and link prediction in heterogeneous networks. 

## Motivation

I found a lack of good examples and resources specifically addressing the creation of heterogeneous node embeddings. Hence, I decided to create this project not only for my own learning but also to provide a starting point for others who might be facing similar challenges.

## Why You Should Check This Out

If you're interested in diving into the graph-based data science and are looking for a practical example to get started with heterogeneous node embeddings, I thought this simple project would be an good example to start with.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository to your local machine and explore the code and documentation provided.
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```
